Employee Retention Prediction ðŸš€

A machine learning project that predicts employee retention using various classification algorithms.

* Overview
This project analyzes employee data to predict whether an employee is likely to stay or leave a company. The dataset contains various features like city, education level, experience, company size, and more. We apply different machine learning models to evaluate and compare their performance.

* Dataset
The project uses two datasets:

  -aug_train.csv: Training dataset

  -aug_test.csv: Testing dataset


* Key Steps in the Project


* âœ” Data Preprocessing
  -Handling missing values
  
  -Encoding categorical features
  
  -Normalization & standardization


* âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  -Understanding numerical and categorical feature distributions
  
  -Detecting potential biases and outliers
  
  -Visualizing trends using histograms, box plots, and bar charts


* âœ” Feature Engineering

  -One-hot encoding categorical features
  
  -Selecting relevant features for training

* âœ” Model Training & Evaluation

  -Logistic Regression
  
  -Random Forest Classifier
  
  -K-Nearest Neighbors
  
  -Evaluated using Accuracy & F1-Score

* âœ” Results & Insights

    -Identified key factors influencing employee retention
  
    -Compared model performances using accuracy and F1-score

* This code segment helps us to understand the categorical data within the datasets by identifying the different categories (unique values) and how often they occur (value counts) for each categorical column in both the training and test datasets.

*The code selects the numerical columns (city_development_index, training_hours) from both df_test and df_train DataFrames. It then uses the .describe() method to calculate and display descriptive statistics (like mean, standard deviation, min, max, percentiles) for these columns in both datasets, enabling easy comparison of their numerical characteristics.
