Employee Retention Prediction ðŸš€

A machine learning project that predicts employee retention using various classification algorithms.

* Overview
This project analyzes employee data to predict whether an employee is likely to stay or leave a company. The dataset contains various features like city, education level, experience, company size, and more. We apply different machine learning models to evaluate and compare their performance.

* Dataset
The project uses two datasets:

  -aug_train.csv: Training dataset

  -aug_test.csv: Testing dataset


* Key Steps in the Project


* âœ” Data Preprocessing
  -Handling missing values
  
  -Encoding categorical features
  
  -Normalization & standardization


* âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  -Understanding numerical and categorical feature distributions
  
  -Detecting potential biases and outliers
  
  -Visualizing trends using histograms, box plots, and bar charts


* âœ” Feature Engineering

  -One-hot encoding categorical features
  
  -Selecting relevant features for training

* âœ” Model Training & Evaluation

  -Logistic Regression
  
  -Random Forest Classifier
  
  -K-Nearest Neighbors
  
  -Evaluated using Accuracy & F1-Score

* âœ” Results & Insights

    -Identified key factors influencing employee retention
  
    -Compared model performances using accuracy and F1-score
